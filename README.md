# Veracode Workflow Extension

Veracode has released the Veracode Workflow Extension that allows you to scan your Azure Devops repositories with Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis (SCA). The extension uses template workflows in a centralized location that you can apply to all repositories across your organization.

The functionality of the extension includes:

Automated scans of up to thousands of repositories from one location

Static and SCA scans start on developer activity from a single workflow

Automated scanning does not require developers to configure workflows for individual repositories

You can install the extension from the Veracode Platform.  For more information, view the Veracode Documentation.
